Description: An app that gets as input the amount of a bill for particular period and the days
             that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period and return how much
             each flatmate has to pay. It also generates a PDF report stating tha names of
             the flatmates, the period, and how much each of them had to pay.

Objects: If wee make a good description, looking into the nouns we can identify how many
         objects we will need.
Objects: Nouns: app, amount, bill, period, days, flatmates, house, PDF Report, names.
Objects: -app: This is the app we are creating so this will not be and object
         -amount: Amount is an attribute of the bill.
         -period: Period is also an attribute of bill.
         -days: This is an attribute of flatmate.
         -flatmate: This will be an object.
         -house: Is just a noun of the description but is not useful in the program.

         an action. We have to calculate the total value.
